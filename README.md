## About Me

I am Dmitry, currently studying computer science at Simon Fraser University and building useful tools with Swift, Python, and a bit of machine learning.
With a background in software engineering and project coordination, I bridge the gap between technical development and project management translating user needs into clear goals and delivering practical tools serving diverse range of users.

### Goals
To build solid, real-world applications while growing into a Project Manager role in software development.
